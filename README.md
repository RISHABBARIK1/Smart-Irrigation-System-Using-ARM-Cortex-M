India's rapidly growing population need a swift advancement in food production technology.The primary sector of the Indian economy is agriculture. The primary resource for agriculture is water. Thus, effective water management is essential for maintaining freshwater resources. to conserve water while raising agricultural yields Irrigation must be done properly. It's common knowledge that drip irrigation is incredibly cost-effective and productive. A traditional drip irrigation system is completely managed and overseen by the farmer. This study shows a fully automated driP irrigation system that uses an ARM7 CPU for control and monitoring.The system's valves are automatically turned ON or OFF for varying periods of time based on the moisture content of the soil, which is monitored by sensors. Because the pH of the soil influences the availability of nutrients in the soil, it is also a crucial aspect to take into account. A sensor is used to measure the pH of the soil, and the results are utilised to provide the farmer with recommendations for maintaining the ideal pH. One of the key macronutrients in the soil is nitrogen. It's an essential nutritional molecule for the growth of plants. A sensor is used to measure the nitrogen content of the soil, and recommendations for maintaining the nitrogen level are sent to the farmer based on the nitrogen content that is now available.


The "Smart Irrigation System with ARM Cortex-M" project addressesthe pressing need for efficient water management in agriculture by leveraging the computational power of the ARM Cortex-M microcontroller. In contemporary agriculture, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, making it imperative to develop intelligent irrigation systems capable of conserving water resources while ensuring optimal crop growth. The proposed system integrates realtime soil moisture monitoring with automated water flow control, contributing to sustainable agricultural practices. The core functionality of the system revolves around the establishment of a user-defined moisture threshold within the code. This threshold serves as a reference point for determining the soil's moisture content. The ARM Cortex-M microcontroller facilitates the seamless integration of a soil moisture sensor, which actively measures and relays the current moisture levels in the soil. Subsequently, a sophisticated decision-making algorithm compares these measurements with the preset threshold. If the observed moisture levels fall below the predefined threshold, the system triggers a responsive water flow mechanism to irrigate the soil, maintaining an optimal moisture balance conducive to plant growth.
